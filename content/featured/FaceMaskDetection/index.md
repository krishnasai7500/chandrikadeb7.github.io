This project estimates the real-time vehicle speed on roads from any real-time stream or recorded video and done for the evaluation by synergy labs Pvt ltd. Libraries and funtions used: KNN background subtraction and morphology to isolate the vehicles and detect their contours, dlib, open cv for image processing, NumPy for mathematical operations, flask as a framework, docker for deployment.Inspired by Adrian Rosebrock [Blog](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/12/02/opencv-vehicle-detection-tracking-and-speed-estimation/).
