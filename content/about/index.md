Hello! Interestingly, I have been a student of Maths in my high school and got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [KL University](https://www.kluniversity.in/). Since then, I started developing Web and ML projects, and completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2018-2022) with 85.0% aggregate.

Today, I'm currently working as a software developer intern as AI and Backend teams in E-unimart.

I have also been awarded as [2nd rank](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W4A7qnwVVtmWtOkuIb1F3n4cN80kMSwW/view?usp=sharing) and scored 248/440 at Code War : Bangalore vs Chennai vs Hyderabad which was conducted by Coding Ninjas
